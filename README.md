# Summa
## A simple spreadsheet for Early Modern British currency

[**Use Summa**](https://gjhilton.github.io/Summa/)

Summa is a simple spreadsheet for historians working with Early Modern British ledgers, accounts and similar documents.

For clerks of the era, summing columns of figures expressed as pounds, shillings and pence in Roman numerals was second nature. For modern users the calculations can be error-prone, and in large quantities quickly become tedious. Summa automates the calculation (and allows you to follow the working out, if you like).

You can also create **extended line items** which are the product of a quantiy times a unit price, e.g. four barrels of beer at 2/- each = 8/-.

And spreadsheets can be nested inside eachother, to create a drilldown from subtotal to finer detail.
